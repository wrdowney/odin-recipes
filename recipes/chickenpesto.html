        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Quick recipe that can be made with prepared gnocchi and pesto, plus chicken breast and fresh mozzarella. Very easy; so easy, I'm sure it borders on a non-recipe. You're really just combining ingredients. You can also experiment with adding other ingredients, like mushrooms or veggies. Anything that needs to be cooked can probably be added at the chicken stage. I did not add any onions or garlic, because the pesto I used already had both, but if your pesto does not, you can add those with the oil as well.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken brest half - cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
                <li>salt and gound black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 (8 oz) jar prepared pesto</li>
                <li>1 (12 oz) package potato gnocchi</li>
                <li>4 oz small fresh mozzarella balls</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper; cook and stir in the hot oil until no longer pink in the middle, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl using a slotted spoon, retaining drippings in the pan.</li>
                <li>Pour chicken broth into the saucepan. Bring broth to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; continue cooking until the broth reduces in volume by about half, 7 to 10 minutes. Return cooked chicken to the saucepan. Stir pesto through the chicken mixture; remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook gnocchi at a boil until they float to the top, about 3 minutes. Remove gnocchi from the water to a large bowl using a slotted spoon, retaining water in the pot.</li>
                <li>Place the saucepan with the chicken and pesto over the boiling water; cook and stir over the boiling water until warmed completely, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken and pesto mixture over the gnocchi; add mozzarella and stir until evenly mixed.</li>
            </ol>
